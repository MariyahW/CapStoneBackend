## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

In this project I will be refactoring a webpage that was primarily html and css to become a full stack webpage. This webpage will be deployed at https://node-app-mariyahw.onrender.com. This is the backend repo the frontend repo can be found at [Frontend](https://github.com/MariyahW/CapStone)

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

### Break down into end to end tests

npm run start
